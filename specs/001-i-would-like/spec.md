# Feature Specification: Personal Expense Tracker

**Feature Branch**: `001-i-would-like`  
**Created**: 2025-10-03  
**Status**: Draft  
**Input**: User description: "I would like to build a Basic expense tracking app (add, view, delete expenses). Track personal expenses with amount, date, category, and description. Simple dashboard showing recent expenses and basic totals. Do not implement user auth, as this is just a personal tracker for myself."

## Execution Flow (main)
```
1. Parse user description from Input
   ‚Üí If empty: ERROR "No feature description provided"
2. Extract key concepts from description
   ‚Üí Identify: actors, actions, data, constraints
3. For each unclear aspect:
   ‚Üí Mark with [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question]
4. Fill User Scenarios & Testing section
   ‚Üí If no clear user flow: ERROR "Cannot determine user scenarios"
5. Generate Functional Requirements
   ‚Üí Each requirement must be testable
   ‚Üí Mark ambiguous requirements
6. Identify Key Entities (if data involved)
7. Run Review Checklist
   ‚Üí If any [NEEDS CLARIFICATION]: WARN "Spec has uncertainties"
   ‚Üí If implementation details found: ERROR "Remove tech details"
8. Return: SUCCESS (spec ready for planning)
```

## ‚ö° Quick Guidelines
- ‚úÖ Focus on WHAT users need and WHY
- ‚ùå Avoid HOW to implement (no tech stack, APIs, code structure)
- üë• Written for business stakeholders, not developers

### Section Requirements
- **Mandatory sections**: Must be completed for every feature
- **Optional sections**: Include only when relevant to the feature
- When a section doesn't apply, remove it entirely (don't leave as "N/A")

### For AI Generation
When creating this spec from a user prompt:
1. **Mark all ambiguities**: Use [NEEDS CLARIFICATION: specific question] for any assumption you'd need to make
2. **Don't guess**: If the prompt doesn't specify something (e.g., "login system" without auth method), mark it
3. **Think like a tester**: Every vague requirement should fail the "testable and unambiguous" checklist item
4. **Common underspecified areas**:
   - User types and permissions
   - Data retention/deletion policies  
   - Performance targets and scale
   - Error handling behaviors
   - Integration requirements
   - Security/compliance needs

## User Scenarios & Testing *(mandatory)*

### Primary User Story
As a personal user, I want to track my daily expenses with relevant details so that I can monitor my spending habits and manage my personal finances more effectively.

### Acceptance Scenarios
1. **Given** I am on the dashboard, **When** I add a new expense with amount, date, category, and description, **Then** the expense should be saved and displayed in the recent expenses list.
2. **Given** I have added expenses, **When** I view the dashboard, **Then** I should see a summary of my total spending and recent transactions.
3. **Given** I want to remove an expense, **When** I delete an expense from the list, **Then** it should be removed from the dashboard and totals should update accordingly.
4. **Given** I want to view my spending by category, **When** I look at the dashboard, **Then** I should see a breakdown of expenses by category.

### Edge Cases
- What happens when I try to add an expense with a future date?
- How does the system handle negative amounts or zero values?
- What happens if I try to delete an expense that doesn't exist?
- How does the system handle very large expense amounts or descriptions?

## Requirements *(mandatory)*

### Functional Requirements
- **FR-001**: System MUST allow adding new expenses with the following fields:
  - Amount (numeric, required)
  - Date (date picker, required)
  - Category (predefined list, required)
  - Description (text, optional)
- **FR-002**: System MUST display a list of recent expenses sorted by date (newest first)
- **FR-003**: System MUST provide a way to delete individual expenses
- **FR-004**: System MUST show a dashboard with:
  - Total expenses for the current month
  - Breakdown of expenses by category
  - Recent transactions list (last 10 entries)
- **FR-005**: System MUST persist all expense data between sessions
- **FR-006**: System MUST validate input data (e.g., positive amounts, valid dates)
- **FR-007**: System MUST provide visual feedback for all user actions (success/error messages)
- **FR-008**: System MUST allow filtering expenses by date range and category

### Key Entities
- **Expense**: Represents a single expense entry
  - id: Unique identifier
  - amount: Numeric value of the expense (positive number)
  - date: Date when the expense occurred
  - category: Predefined category (e.g., Food, Transportation, Entertainment)
  - description: Optional text description
  - createdAt: Timestamp when the record was created
  - updatedAt: Timestamp when the record was last modified

- **Category**: Predefined list of expense categories
  - name: Category name (e.g., "Food", "Transportation")
  - color: Visual indicator for the category
  - icon: Optional icon representation
